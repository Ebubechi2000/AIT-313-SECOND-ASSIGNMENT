QUESTION 1
COMPARE AND CONTRAST AUGUMENTED INTELLIGENCE AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
a. AI aims to create autonomous systems that can perform tasks independently, simulating human intelligence. 

b. AI focuses on creating autonomous systems that simulate human intelligence WHILE Augmented Intelligence aims to enhance human capabilities by leveraging machine intelligence. Both technologies have the potential to transform industries and revolutionize the way we work

c. AI relies heavily on large datasets to learn and improve, WHILE Augmented Intelligence can function with smaller datasets and more human input.

d. AI models can be difficult to interpret and explain, WHILE Augmented Intelligence systems are designed to provide transparent and explainable recommendations.

e. AI systems often require human oversight to correct errors or biases, WHILE Augmented Intelligence systems are designed to collaborate with humans and learn from their feedback.

f. AI systems can be domain agnostic, WHILE Augmented Intelligence systems often require domain-specific knowledge and expertise.

5 AI systems can be designed to scale horizontally,WHILE  Augmented Intelligence systems often require more vertical scaling, with a focus on human-machine collaboration.
